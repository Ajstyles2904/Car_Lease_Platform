# Car_Lease_Platform
Car lease Platform allows users to manage a fleet of cars, register customers, rent and return vehiclesâ€”all through a simple text-based menu. It uses object-oriented concepts to track car availability, compute rental costs based on daily rates and duration, and maintain rental history.
